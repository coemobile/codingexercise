# Full Stack Developer Coding Exercise
A coding exercise to assess the competency of candidates.

## Requirements

* Node.js, `npm` and `bower` installed
* SQLite3 installed

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the backend dependencies

        npm install

3. Install the frontend dependencies

        bower install

## Usage

Launch the express server:

    DEBUG=codingexercise:* npm start

And open your browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Chosen solution

I develop a simple and easy to use _todo_ list. I made the backend using Node.js, Express and Sequelize (with SQLite3). For the frontend, I choose to design a responsible web application using AngularJS and Materialize.

The required functionalities were implemented as follow: View all todos (list), add a todo (create), check a todo (update) and remove a todo (delete).

The solution could be improved by adding input validation on both the backend and the frontend, and by improving the error handling on the backend side.
